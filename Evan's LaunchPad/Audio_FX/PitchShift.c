 *      A Time-domain pitch shifting implementation
 *
 *      Utilizing a buffer, we write to the buffer at a constant rate
 *      and using fractionals we are able to read from the buffer at a different rate
 *      producing a shift in the pitch without affecting length of audio
 *
 *      When the one pointer gets closer to overlapping the other pointer, we crossfade too prevent glitches in audio
